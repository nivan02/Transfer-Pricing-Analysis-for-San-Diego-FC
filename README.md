# âš½ Soccer Transfer Analysis Dashboard

This project presents an **interactive dashboard** designed to analyze soccer player transfers, valuations, and performance metrics. The goal was to support strategic recruitment decisions by combining player performance data, transfer market trends, and valuation insights into one consolidated tool.

The dashboard provides a **data-driven approach to scouting and transfer planning**, allowing clubs to shortlist players, compare performance, analyze market value trends, and plan future transfers with budget constraints in mind.
